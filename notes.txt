ptx-linker must be patched to use 0.2.0 rustc-llvm-linker and then installed

Requires CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING=false to avoid "crate foo required to be available in rlib format...",
but only when device code is a separate crate?

Device code should be separate crate to avoid problems with no-std dependencies. When host and device code are used
in the same crate with conditional compilation and both transitively depend on the same crate (e.g. num-traits for
num-complex), but one of them does not disable "std" feature, cargo tries to build the device dependency *with* std,
even though ptx-builder is using a different target.
